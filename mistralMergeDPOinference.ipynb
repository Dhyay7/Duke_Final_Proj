      "To determine whether a given number `n` is a power of four or not, we need to check if it can be expressed as `4^k`, where `k` is some non-negative integer. One way to approach this problem is by repeatedly dividing the number by 4 until either we reach 1 (which means the original number was indeed a power of four), or the quotient becomes less than 1. Here's how you could implement this in code:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class Solution:\n",
      "    def isPowerOfFour(self, n: int) -> bool:\n",
      "        # Divide n by 4 repeatedly while n > 0 and quotient >= 1\n",
      "        while n > 0 and n % 4 == 0:\n",
      "            quotient = n // 4\n",
      "            n = quotient\n",
      "        \n",
      "        # Check if the final value of n is equal to 1\n",
      "        # If so, then the original number was a power of four\n",
      "        return n == 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "In the above implementation, we use a `while` loop to keep dividing `n` by 4 as long as both conditions are met: `n > 0` and the remainder when dividing `n` by 4 is zero (i.e., `n % 4 == 0`). The variable `quotient` stores the result of each division operation. Once the loop terminates, we check if the final value of `n` is equal to 1. If it is, then the original number was indeed a power of four, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's test our solution with the example inputs from the question:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Create an instance of the Solution class\n",
      "sol = Solution()\n",
      "# Test input 1: n = 16\n",
      "assert sol.isPowerOfFour(16) == True\n",
      "# Test input 2: n = 5\n",
      "assert sol.isPowerOfFour(5) == False\n",
      "# Test input 3: n = 1\n",
      "assert sol.isPowerOfFour(1) == True\n",

      "# To calculate the average of a subtree, we first find the height of the current node using the helper function `_get_height()`. Then, based on the height, we can determine the number of leaf nodes in the subtree using the formula `pow(2, height) - 1`. Since the average of a single node is simply the node's value itself, we only need to consider the non-leaf nodes when calculating the average. Therefore, the total number of nodes in the subtree is the sum of the leaf nodes and the number of non-leaf nodes.\n",
      "# Once we have the total number of nodes, we can calculate the average by dividing the total sum of values by the total number of nodes. If the absolute difference between the calculated average and the node's value is less than a small epsilon (`1e-9`), then we increment the count of nodes whose average matches their own value. Finally, we return the count of such nodes as the output.\n",
      "# Note that since the input binary tree may be large, it's important to optimize the code to minimize redundant calculations. One way to achieve this is by memoizing the results of previous subtree averages using a dictionary or hash table, so that they don't need to be recalculated during subsequent traversals. This can significantly improve the performance of the algorithm.</s>\n",

      "   - If they are different but the next integer in the stream doesn't match the top of the stack, we add a \"Pop\" operation to the `order` list and remove the top of the stack. This ensures that the incorrect value is removed from the stack.\n",

      "2. The `findDifferentBinaryString` method takes a list of binary strings called `nums` as input. Our goal is to find a binary string of length `n` that doesn't appear in `nums`.\n",
      "3. Inside the method, we create an empty set called `binary_set` to store all the binary strings from `nums`.\n",
      "4. Next, we iterate through each binary string in `nums` and add it to the `binary_set` using the `add()` method.\n",
      "5. After processing all the binary strings in `nums`, we use recursion to generate all possible binary strings of length `n` using the helper function `generate_binaries()`.\n",
      "6. The `generate_binaries()` function takes one argument called `remaining_bits`, which represents the number of bits left to generate. It uses memoization with the `@lru_cache` decorator to avoid redundant calculations.\n",
      "7. Within the `generate_binaries()` function, we check if `remaining_bits` equals zero. If it does, we yield an empty binary string since we have reached the end of generating all possible combinations.\n",
      "8. Otherwise, we concatenate \"0\" with the result of calling `generate_binaries()` recursively with `remaining_bits - 1` and reversing the order of the output using slicing (`[::-1]`) before yielding it. Similarly, we concatenate \"1\" with the reversed result of calling `generate_binaries()` recursively with `remaining_bits - 1` and yielding it.\n",
      "9. Finally, we loop through all the binary strings generated by `generate_binaries()` until we find one that is not already present in the `binary_set`. Once we find such a binary string, we immediately return it as our answer.\n",
      "10. If no binary string is found that is not present in `nums`, we return an empty string as the answer.\n",
      "Overall, the code generates all possible binary strings of length `n` using recursion and checks each one against the binary strings in `nums` stored in the `binary_set`. The first binary string that is not present in `nums` is returned as the answer.</s>\n",

If it is a multiple of 7, we can simply count the number of full weeks and remaining weekend days separately. Otherwise, we need to adjust the calculation slightly to account for fewer than 7 days remaining after the last full week.\n",
      "3. For the full weeks, we calculate the total amount by summing up the contributions on all the Mondays within those weeks. Since the contribution on each Monday increases by `$1`, we use a loop to iterate through the number of full weeks and calculate the corresponding Monday amounts. The variable `total_weekdays` stores the sum of these amounts.\n",
      "4. For the remaining days, we calculate the total amount by summing up the daily increases for each of the remaining days. We again use a loop to iterate through the number of remaining days and calculate the corresponding daily increases. The variable `total_remaining_days` stores the sum of these increases.\n",
      "5. Finally, we combine the total amounts from the full weeks and remaining days with the contribution on the last weekday and the next Monday to get the overall total amount. This involves adding the `total_weekdays`, `total_remaining_days`, the contribution on the last weekday (which is equal to `monday_amount + daily_increase * (number of full weeks + 1)`), and the contribution on the next Monday (which is equal to `monday_amount + daily_increase * (number of full weeks + 2)`).\n",

      "Here's a breakdown of how the code works:\n",

      "1. We start by defining the `helper` function, which takes a `TreeNode` object called `node` as its argument. It checks whether `node` is `None`, indicating a null node. If so, it returns an empty string since there's nothing to represent. Otherwise, it proceeds with the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The function recursively calls itself with the left and right children of the current node using the variables `left_subtree` and `right_subtree`, respectively. These recursive calls generate the string representations of their respective subtrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Inside the loop, we concatenate the string representation of the current node's value (obtained by converting it to a string using `str()`) with the left and right subtrees' string representations, wrapped in parentheses.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. After generating the full string representation, we remove any unnecessary empty parentheses pairs using conditional statements. Specifically, we check if the length of the resulting string is greater than 2 and the last two characters are both opening and closing parentheses ('(' and ')'). If true, we remove these characters using slicing (`output[:-2]`). Similarly, if the length of the string is greater than 3 and the last three characters match \"(())\", we remove them using slicing (`output[:-3]`).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Finally, we return the modified string representation of the entire tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. In the `tree2str` function, we call `helper` with the input root node and store the returned string representation in a variable. Then, we simply return this string to complete the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "By combining the recursive traversal and string manipulation steps, we can efficiently generate the desired string representation of the binary tree while maintaining the specified formatting rules.</s>\n",

      "The above code uses a dictionary called `freq_count` to store the frequency count of each unique element in the input array `arr`. The `for` loop iterates through each number in the array and updates the corresponding frequency count in the dictionary accordingly using list comprehension or nested `if-else` statements. After counting all frequencies, we calculate the total frequency by summing up all values in the dictionary using the `sum()` function. Then, another loop iterates through the dictionary to find the element with the highest frequency greater than the threshold of `total_freq/4`. Finally, the special integer is returned as output. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, since we only need to traverse the array once to perform the frequency count operation. Additionally, the use of a dictionary allows us to efficiently store and access the frequency counts without having to sort the entire array.</s>\n",

This approach eliminates the need for additional data structures and simplifies the code. The time complexity remains O(rmn) as we still have two nested loops over rows and columns.</s>\n",

Then it iterates through the sorted list using a `for` loop, comparing adjacent elements to calculate the difference in their x-coordinates. If this difference is greater than the current value of `ans`, then `ans` is updated accordingly. Finally, the largest value of `ans` is returned as the result.

By reversing the original list and then applying the `sorted()` function, we get the desired result. The resulting sorted list is stored in `sorted_cookies`.\n",
      "3. Now, we iterate through each child's greed factor using a loop and keep track of the number of content children in the variable `count`. For each child, we perform a binary search using the `bisect_left()` function to find the index of the smallest cookie whose size is greater than or equal to the child's greed factor.\n",
      "4. If such a cookie exists (the index is less than the length of `sorted_cookies`), we increment the `count` variable and move on to the next child. Otherwise, no cookie satisfies the child's greed factor, so we don't increment the count.\n",
      "5. Finally, after iterating through all the children, we return the value of `count`, which represents the maximum number of content children.\n",

      "In this solution, we first traverse the linked list starting from the head until we reach the node that comes just before the left position (left - 1). We store the previous node encountered in the variable \"prev\\_node\". Then, we continue traversing the linked list until we reach the node that comes after the right position (right + 1). We store the last node visited in the variable \"end\\_node\" and the second last node visited in the variable \"start\\_node\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we reverse the order of the nodes within the sublist by updating their pointers. Starting from the current node, we set its next pointer to point to the previously visited node (\"end\\_node\") and its prev pointer to point to the previously visited node's prev pointer (\"prev\\_node\"). We also update the prev pointer of the previously visited node to point to the current node and the next pointer of the next node to be the reversed node. This way, we effectively reverse the order of the nodes within the sublist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we set the prev\\_node's next pointer to point to the start\\_node of the reversed sublist and update the overall head of the linked list accordingly. The reversed sublist now becomes part of the original linked list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: In the follow-up question, it would require reversing the entire linked list in O(n) time complexity using only constant extra space. One possible approach could involve recursively reversing each half of the linked list separately and then merging them together. However, that is beyond the scope of the given problem statement.</s>\n",

      "The solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to generate all possible combinations of valid IP addresses by inserting dots at appropriate positions in the input string `s`. The function `backtrack` takes two arguments - `_start` and `_end`, representing the starting and ending indices of the current segment being processed. It recursively generates valid combinations for each segment and combines them with the current digit to form an IP address. The results are stored in a memoization table using the `@lru_cache` decorator to avoid redundant calculations. Finally, the generated IP addresses are added to a list called `res`, deduplicated and sorted alphabetically before returning the final result.\n",
      "Note: The use of `@lru_cache` requires Python >=3.7 due to its experimental nature. If you're using an older version of Python, consider implementing your own memoization table manually instead.</s>\n",

      "2. To find the root of the tree, we first determine the total number of nodes in the linked list using the helper function `_countNodes`. This information will be used later to ensure that each subtree has roughly half the number of nodes as its parent.\n",
      "3. We then call another helper function `_buildSubtree` with the head of the linked list and the calculated target size (half of the total nodes). This function recursively builds the binary search tree by finding the middle node of the current subtree and creating two child subtrees based on the remaining nodes.\n",
      "4. In the `_buildSubtree` function, we check if the given node is either empty or its next node is also empty. If so, this node becomes the root of the tree. Otherwise, we find the middle node of the current subtree using the `_findMidpoint` helper function and create two child subtrees recursively. Finally, we connect the three parts together to form the binary search tree.\n",
      "5. The `_countNodes` function simply counts the number of nodes in the linked list by iterating through it until the end.\n",
      "6. The `_buildSubtree` and `_findMidpoint` functions use additional helper variables and logic to navigate the linked list and find the appropriate nodes to split into subtrees.\n",
      "7. Overall, the resulting binary search tree will have a height close to log base 2 of the total number of nodes, ensuring good balance and efficient searching.</s>\n",

      "In this solution, we use an auxiliary sorted list represented by a new singly linked list called `sorted_list`.

This will ensure that any existing values in the original list are greater than the initial value of the sorted list. Then, we traverse the original list starting from the second node and perform insertionsort on each element by finding its correct position in the sorted list and swapping its value accordingly. After processing all nodes in the original list, we update the reference to the last sorted node's previous pointer to point to the head of the sorted list, which is then returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "By performing the insertion sort in-place like this, we avoid having to create a new list altogether, making the time complexity O(n^2) for the worst case scenario where the list is reversely ordered.

      "The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation inside the loop, but without actually performing a sorting algorithm explicitly. The space complexity is O(n) as we need to store all the squared numbers in memory before returning them. However, if you want to avoid the sorting operation altogether, you can modify the code to keep track of the smallest squared value encountered so far and update it whenever a smaller squared value is found.

      "In order to remove the nth node from the end of the linked list, we need to determine the position of that node based on the length of the list and then modify the pointers accordingly. Here's how we can achieve it:\n",
      "1. First, we traverse the entire linked list using two pointers `current_node` and `step`. We increment the counter `count` whenever we visit a new node. The purpose of `step` will be clear later.\n",
      "2. If we are asked to delete the first node, we simply update the `head` pointer to point to the second node in the list.\n",
      "3. Otherwise, we calculate the position of the nth node from the end by subtracting n from the total count and adding 1. Then, we move the `step` pointer forward by that amount.\n",
      "4. Finally, we modify the `next` pointer of the second last node (pointed by `step`) to skip over the last node (nth node). This effectively removes the nth node from the end of the list.\n",
      "5. Return the updated `head` pointer as the result.\n",
      "Note: In the follow-up question, we are required to solve the problem in a single pass without counting the nodes or storing any extra information. One possible solution involves creating a dummy node at the beginning of the list and reversing the list recursively until we reach the desired position to delete the node. However, that approach may not be very efficient compared to the above method.</s>\n",

      "\n",
      "Nanotechnology has been widely used in the field of medicine. Nanomaterials have shown great potential for use as a drug carrier to deliver drugs into tumor cells and tissues. In this study, we synthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with different sizes by using sodium citrate reduction method. The AuNPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential measurements. We also investigated the cytotoxicity of AuNPs on human breast cancer cell line MCF7 and normal human mammary epithelial cell line HMEC. Our results showed that the size of AuNPs had an effect on their toxicity. Smaller particles exhibited higher toxicity than larger ones. The mechanism of action was studied by measuring the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). It was found that smaller AuNPs induced more ROS production and caused greater loss of ΔΨm compared to larger ones. These results suggest that the size of AuNPs is important when they are used as a drug carrier.\n",
