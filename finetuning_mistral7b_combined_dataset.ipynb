      "# However, it may be slightly faster for larger inputs because it avoids the need to perform repeated divisions.\n",

      "# If the result is equal to the input number, then it is a power of four.\n",
      "# Otherwise, it is not.\n",
      "# This approach has a time complexity of O(loglogn), which is slightly better than the previous one.\n",
      "# However, it requires the use of the logarithm function, which may have a higher constant factor than the division operation.\n",
      "# Therefore, the actual performance may depend on the specific implementation of these functions.\n",
      "# Overall, both approaches are efficient and can be used depending on the desired trade-off between simplicity and speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Additional Constraints:\n",
      "# The input number n can be represented in binary form as a string.\n",
      "# We can convert it to decimal representation and apply the same logic as before.\n",
      "# This approach has the same time and space complexities as the previous ones.\n",
      "# However, it may be slightly faster for very large inputs because it avoids the need to perform arithmetic operations on integers.\n",

      "#\n",
      "# Example:\n",
      "# Let's calculate the total amount of money after 20 days:\n",
      "# - The sum of the first 7 days is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28.\n",
      "# - The sum of the remaining 13 days is 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 = 78.\n",
      "# - Since 20 is not divisible by 7, we don't need to add any extra sum.\n",
      "# - The total amount of money after 20 days is 28 + 78 + 1 = 107.\n",
      "#\n",
      "# Note:\n",
      "# - In the code above, we use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is divisible by 7.\n",
      "# - If the remainder of the division is 0, the number is divisible by 7.\n",
      "# - Otherwise, we add an additional sum of 7 numbers starting from 2 and increasing by 1 each day.\n",
      "# - This ensures that we cover all cases, including when the number of days is divisible by 7.\n",

      "# We iterate through the array once to build a frequency table.\n",
      "# Then we check if any value in the frequency table has more than one occurrence.\n",
      "# If so, we return False. Otherwise, we return True.\n",
      "# The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the array once.\n",
      "# The space complexity is O(n) because we use a dictionary to store the frequency table.\n",
      "# This solution has a linear time complexity and a constant space complexity.\n",
      "# It uses a single pass through the array to build the frequency table and then checks for duplicates.\n",
      "# This approach is efficient for arrays with up to 10^6 elements.\n",
      "# However, it may not be suitable for larger arrays as the space complexity becomes a concern.\n",
      "# In such cases, a more memory-efficient approach like counting sort can be used.\n",
      "# Counting sort has a space complexity of O(k), where k is the range of input values.\n",
      "# For example, if the input values are integers between -10^9 and 10^9, the space complexity would be O(2 * 10^9).\n",
      "# Counting sort is a good choice when memory usage is a concern, but it requires additional space proportional to the range of input values.\n",
      "# Overall, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages depending on the size of the input array and the available memory.\n",
      "# The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand.\n",
      "# In this case, since the input array size is limited to 10^6, the linear time and space complexity of the given solution is sufficient.\n",
      "# Therefore, the given solution is an appropriate solution for this problem.\n",
      "# However, it's important to note that there might be other solutions with different trade-offs, and the choice of algorithm\n",
