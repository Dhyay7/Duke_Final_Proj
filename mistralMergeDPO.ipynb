      "To determine whether a given number `n` is a power of four or not, we need to check if it can be expressed as `4^k`, where `k` is some non-negative integer. One way to approach this problem is by repeatedly dividing the number by 4 until either we reach 1 (which means the original number was indeed a power of four), or the quotient becomes less than 1. Here's how you could implement this in code:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class Solution:\n",
      "    def isPowerOfFour(self, n: int) -> bool:\n",
      "        # Divide n by 4 repeatedly while n > 0 and quotient >= 1\n",

      "            quotient = n // 4\n",
      "            n = quotient\n",
      "        \n",
      "        # Check if the final value of n is equal to 1\n",
      "        # If so, then the original number was a power of four\n",
      "        return n == 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "In the above implementation, we use a `while` loop to keep dividing `n` by 4 as long as both conditions are met: `n > 0` and the remainder when dividing `n` by 4 is zero (i.e., `n % 4 == 0`). The variable `quotient` stores the result of each division operation. Once the loop terminates, we check if the final value of `n` is equal to 1. If it is, then the original number was indeed a power of four, and we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's test our solution with the example inputs from the question:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Create an instance of the Solution class\n",
      "sol = Solution()\n",
      "# Test input 1: n = 16\n",
      "assert sol.isPowerOfFour(16) == True\n",
      "# Test input 2: n = 5\n",
      "assert sol.isPowerOfFour(5) == False\n",
      "# Test input 3: n = 1\n",
      "assert sol.isPowerOfFour(1) == True\n",
      "```\n",
      "All three tests pass successfully! Therefore, our implementation correctly identifies powers of four based on the given definition.</s>\n",

      "In this solution, we use a dictionary called `freq_dict` to keep track of the frequency of each value encountered during traversal of the binary search tree. We define a helper function `getFrequency()` which takes a node as input and performs the following steps:\n",
      "1. If the node is None, then the frequency is 0.\n",
      "2. Increment the frequency of the current node by 1 in the dictionary.\n",
      "3. Recursively call `getFrequency()` on the left child and right child of the current node.\n",
      "4. Update the maximum frequency `max_freq` seen so far and store the corresponding values in a list called `modes`.\n",
      "5. Return the maximum frequency `max_freq`.\n",
      "After performing the depth-first search of the binary search tree using the helper function, we have the maximum frequency and the corresponding modes stored in `max_freq` and `modes`, respectively. Finally, we convert `modes` into a list and return it as the output.\n",
      "Note that since we are using a dictionary to store frequencies, this solution uses additional space proportional to the number of distinct values in the binary search tree. However, the follow-up question asks to solve the problem\n",

The base cases are when `start == end`, which means there is only one possible way to divide the single-seat section. In this case, we calculate the power of 2 based on the minimum number of seats in the section (up to a maximum of 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "For other cases, we iterate through all positions `i` between `start+1` and `end` and check if the adjacent seats have different types (one 'S' and one 'P'). If they do, then we recursively call `dp` on the substrings before and after `i` and add their results together. Finally, we return the total count of ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the main part of the code, we directly call `dp` with the entire corridor as the input and take the result modulo `10^9 + 7` to get the final answer.\n",

      "This approach uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the number of ways to divide the corridor while avoiding redundant calculations. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and storing their solutions in a cache, we can avoid recomputing them and significantly improve performance.</s>\n",

The `for` loop iterates through each number in the array and updates the corresponding frequency count in the dictionary accordingly using list comprehension or nested `if-else` statements. After counting all frequencies, we calculate the total frequency by summing up all values in the dictionary using the `sum()` function. Then, another loop iterates through the dictionary to find the element with the highest frequency greater than the threshold of `total_freq/4`. Finally, the special integer is returned as output. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, since we only need to traverse the array once to perform the frequency count operation. Additionally, the use of a dictionary allows us to efficiently store and access the frequency counts without having to sort the entire array.</s>\n",

This way, the largest cookies appear first in the sorted list.\n",

Since the leaf values are unique, comparing sorted versions of the lists ensures that the order doesn't matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "To perform DFS, we use two helper data structures - `stack` and `list`. We start by pushing the root node into the stack and appending it to the list. Then, at each step, we pop a node from the stack and check if it's a leaf node (i.e., has no children). If so, we append its value to the corresponding list. Finally, before moving on to the next node, we push its children onto the stack. This way, when we reach a leaf node, we've already processed all its ancestors.\n",

      "To perform bottom-up level order traversal, we use a queue to keep track of nodes at different levels. We start by adding the root node to the queue along with its depth (initialized as 0). Then, we repeatedly remove the node with the smallest depth from the queue and append its value to the appropriate list based on its depth using a dictionary called `result`. Finally, we also enqueue the left and right children of the current node with their respective updated depths. This process continues until the queue becomes empty. At the end, we reverse the order of the lists within the dictionary values and return them as the final output.\n",
      "In terms of time complexity, since we are performing a breadth-first search (BFS), the worst case scenario would be when all nodes have exactly two children, resulting in O(n) operations where n is the total number of nodes in the tree. The space complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree due to the maximum depth that can be reached by any node being stored in the queue. However, since the tree is balanced, the height will typically be logarithmic to the number of nodes, making the overall space complexity O(log n).</s>\n",

      "To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to keep track of the minimum element in each contiguous subarray of length `k+1`. We will store these minimum elements in an array called `prefix_sum` of size `n+k`, where `n` is the length of the input array `arr`. The first `k` indices of `prefix_sum` will store the minimum elements of the initial subarray of length `k+1`. For subsequent subarrays, we will update the minimum element by comparing it with the last element of the previous subarray and updating accordingly. Additionally, we will calculate the difference between the minimum elements of adjacent subarrays and add that to the updated prefix sum. Finally, we will iterate through all possible subarrays and compute their sum modulo `10^9 + 7` to get the final answer.\n",

We create a hashmap called `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each element. Then, we iterate through the list of elements and update their corresponding frequencies accordingly. After updating the frequencies, we find the duplicate number by checking for any keys in the hashmap with a value greater than 1. In this case, the duplicate number is 2. To find the missing number, we calculate the sum of the expected values (the sequence 1+2+...+n) and compare it with the actual sum of the remaining unique elements. Here, the expected sum would be 45 and the actual sum would be 1+2+4=7, so the missing number is 39-7=32. Finally, we return the result as a list containing both the duplicate and\n",

      "# \n",

      "# \n",
      "# In the `put` method, we follow similar steps but instead of updating the order of usage, we remove any existing node with the same key and replace it with a new node containing the updated key-value pair.

      "In this solution, we use an auxiliary sorted list represented by a new singly linked list called `sorted_list`. We start by creating a dummy node with a negative infinite value as its value (-inf). This will ensure that any existing values in the original list are greater than the initial value of the sorted list. Then, we traverse the original list starting from the second node and perform insertionsort on each element by finding its correct position in the sorted list and swapping its value accordingly. After processing all nodes in the original list, we update the reference to the last sorted node's previous pointer to point to the head of the sorted list, which is then returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "By performing the insertion sort in-place like this, we avoid having to create a new list altogether, making the time complexity O(n^2) for the worst case scenario where the list is reversely ordered. However, since the average case complexity of insertion sort is O(n), the overall performance should be quite efficient for most cases.</s>\n",

      "In the given problem, we are required to find the number of days we need to wait after each day to get a warmer temperature. To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure to maintain track of the indices of the previous elements in descending order. We will iterate backwards through the list of temperatures and at each step, check if the current temperature is greater than any of the temperatures present in the stack. If it is, then we remove all the elements from the stack whose temperatures are less than the current temperature and update their corresponding positions in the ans array with the difference between their indices. Finally, we push the current index onto the stack if its temperature is greater than the top element in the stack. After iterating through the entire list, we return the ans array as the final output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time complexity of the above solution would be O(n^2) due to nested loops where n is the length of the input list. However, by using a stack, we can reduce the space complexity to O(n). The overall space complexity of the solution would be O(n).</s>\n",

      "3. After reversing the order of the words, we join them back together into a single string using the `join()` method. Here, we pass the reversed `words_list` as the iterable argument and specify the string \" \" as the separator. This results in a reversed string where each word is separated by a single space.\n",

However, by reversing the order of the elements in the `words_list` using list slicing, we effectively reverse the order of the individual words while keeping the original string unchanged. Therefore, the follow-up question asking for an in-place solution with O(1) extra space would not apply here.</s>\n",

      "1. We import the `collections` module and specifically use its `Counter` class to count the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.\n",
      "2. We store the frequency counts in a dictionary called `freq_count`.\n",
      "3. To get the sorted keys (characters), we convert `freq_count` into an ordered dictionary called `sorted_freq`, where the keys are sorted in descending order based on their frequencies.\n",
      "4. We then iterate through the sorted keys in `sorted_freq` and append each character repeated according to its frequency to the `ans` string.\n",
      "5. Finally, we return the resulting `ans` string which contains all the characters sorted by their frequencies in descending order.\n",
      "By using the `collections.Counter()` function, we can efficiently count the occurrences of each character in the given string without having to manually loop through each character individually. Additionally, converting `freq_count` into an ordered dictionary allows us to easily retrieve the sorted keys, making the overall solution more concise and efficient.</s>\n",

If any value exceeds the majority count, we immediately return that element as the majority element.\n",

In such cases, we calculate the remaining majority count required to form a majority by subtracting twice the majority count from the total length of `nums`. Then, we iterate through the distinct elements in `nums` using a set to eliminate duplicates and check their counts in the hashmap. If any count matches or exceeds the remaining majority count, we return that element as the majority element.\n",

      "# In the above code, we first sort the input list 'nums' in ascending order using the built-in sort function. Then, we iterate through each element of the sorted list except the last two elements as they cannot form part of any mountain triplet. For each element at index 'i', we perform binary search on both sides to find the smallest element greater than it and the largest element smaller than it respectively. We check whether these two elements form a mountain by comparing them with the element at index 'i'. If they do, then we calculate the sum of the three elements and update the variable 'ans' accordingly. Finally, we return the value of 'ans' which will contain the minimum possible sum of a mountain triplet if one exists, otherwise '-1'. The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2) due to nested loops where n is the length of the input list.</s>\n",
